My first repository

Hopefully, the first of many! 
Is that too cheesy?

Anywho, I'm just a test repository. Don't mind me. Basic to the end.

About @tinawju, the user: 

Hey, world! I'm Tina, and I like biotech and computers. 

Freshman year of high school, I learned Java in CS class and worked with some friends to make a new Pokemon game as our final project. I also did my first biology research project: The Effect of Ethanol on Learning Rate in Girardia Tigrina. Basically, I got these flatworms, called Planaria, drunk and blew bubbles in their "faces." I've been going back and forth between wetware and software ever since! 

And, of course, a shameless plug: STANFORD 2018. The wind of freedom blows! :D
